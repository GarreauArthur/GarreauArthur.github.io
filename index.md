Genius, Developer, AI enthusiast, Piano prodigy, I like to build stuffs.

My name is Arthur Garreau (<small>it's written in giant up there</small>), I
study Computer Science, Electronics, Artificial Intelligence, Data...

I wrote my first line of code when I was 12yo, but got serious about it when I
was 15. I made a couple of interesting projects, but I shared a very few of
them, because I didn't want to share them, or I never finished them, or they
were not really interesting, u kno wat im sayin.

I have a licence (french equivalent of a bachelor, but not really) in
Electronics, Electrical Energy, and automatic.
