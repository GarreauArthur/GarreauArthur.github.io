			Introduction
			--><p>I have no idea what you are doing here, whatever, <b>why am I even building this website already ?</b>
			<br>Oh actually, yes I remember, it's because I wanted to make a blog, and show off my skills, so people can see how amazing I am<br>
			Long story short, I will publish some shitty articles elsewhere because hum, marketing, <b>draw attention</b>, another website, I need money.
			Maybe I will share some writing or some stuff here, but, I am too lazy to set up a blog engine here, for now...
			So... I will write it in text/html directly in the source, because it works, and when it will start being annoying I will put efforts into a real engine.<br>
			<b>Stop</b> being on my back, it's not a fancy website with colors, animations, fucking CSS prowess, images... But you know what It's beautiful<br><br>so stfu and enjoy <small>stupid cunt (jk, I love u)</small></p><!--

SAD but will not happen
		My name is Arthur Garreau (<small>it's written in giant up there</small>), I study Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data<a href="http://dac.lip6.fr/master/">...</a> at the <a href="http://www.upmc.fr/en/">Pierre and Marie Curie</a> university in Paris. 
			--><p>My name is Arthur Garreau (<small>it's written in giant up there</small>), I study Computer Science, Electronics, Artificial Intelligence, Data...
			I wrote my first line of code when I was 12yo, but got serious about it when I was 15. I made a couple of interesting projects, but I shared a very few of them, because I didn't want to share them, or I never finished them, or they were not really interesting, u kno wat im sayin.<br>
			I have a licence (french equivalent of a bachelor, but not really) in Electronics, Electrical Energy, and automatic.<br>
			I like to build stuffs<br>
			<br>
			<small>omg, I was, yeah let write something about me, it's gonna be cool, but it's just really boring</small>
			<br><br>
			Seriously, I am like thinking about things to write about me, but who givesafuck ?
			</p><!--

		--><h2>The quest for Artificial Intelligence</h2><!--
			--><p>
			I told my mom, I was going to build a robot that will take care of everything she doesn't want to do, so I will do it.
			I realized that we (as human, I mean, if you're not human then what are you ?) waste a lot of time doing annoying, boring stuffs.
			Time is the most valuable thing in the universe. Because once you ran of time, you're dead, DEAD, <big>DEAD</big>. We don't have time to waste our time. Stop reading this, and go do something you enjoy, no, I am just kidding, keep reading, otherwise it would mean I wasted my time.
			<br>
			<br>
			You know, programming is fun, you just need a computer (the Internet is a plus, really appriciate), and you can start building things from scratch.
			But you can't do everything, you can't solve all problems, and I tried to solve a lot of problems you can't solve using traditional programming, or algorithms. The simple reason for that is that you need <b>INTELLIGENCE</b>.
			<br><small>"But what is intelligence ? I mean it's not because I struggle with this math problem that it means that i am an idiot, i am really good at making sand castles, so I am really smart, ok"</small>.
			<br>
			Yeah Yeah Yeah, stfu, I am not trying to define intelligence, you're smart ok, i don't give a fuk
			<br><br>
			So <b>we need intelligence</b>, I need intelligence, I first thought about becoming the king of the world, so I can just pick people and use them as slaves, but apparently it's not really nice, people like to be free, to do whatever they want, to have rights (<small>wtf is this bullshit ???</small>). So we don't have other choice than building it, we need to build intelligence, artificial intelligence. The cool part is, top experts already started, and they've done a pretty good job so far. But it is not enough, we need really smart people (like <big>ME</big>).
			<br>
			Now, machines are becoming good at understanding things, they can see, detect objects, understand and translate texts. They recently start playing games. And that's pretty much all. Not really but do you really expect me to do an exhaustive list ? whatever, It's not enough. we need more, <b>MORE</b>.
			I am interest in some problems, so I will solve them, I don't care if I will need 100 years, I will make it, It will be painful, dark, and the NSA will spy on me, China will try to kidnap me, the reptillians will try to eat me, but the illuminati won't stop me, I tell you. space herpes will not be a problem. I will do it and I will publish my results here, or maybe not, and will just rule the world.
			<br>
			I am still learning, it will take 102 years.
			<br><br>
			-----------------------------------------------brouillon<br>
			Artificial Intelligence is relatively old, but it really began to develop since the years 2010.
			The most successful area of AI is called Deep Learning, for it uses of deep neural networks.
			Deep Neural Networks achieve great performance on specific tasks such as object recognition, speech recognition or atari games.
			<small>Yeah, some guys are so lazy, they trained DNN to play video games for them.</small>
			But we don't know how to build models to excel at a wide variety of tasks. One of the most challenging goals, and I would say the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to build a general-purpose intelligence, an agent able to learn and perform any tasks.
			<br>
			We face several problems :<br>
			1. Catastrophic forgetting, DNN are really good at learning one task, but if the task change, they forget everything<br>
			1.1 solution ? <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796v2.pdf">Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks</a><br>
			1.2 <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/">deep Q-network</a> was able to learn to play across a diverse range of 49 games.<br>
			2. Possibility to act<br>
			<br>
			To be able to do any task, an intelligent agent needs a way to perform it, if it needs to move, it needs wheels or legs ...
			We could try to modify the environment so the agent could access to what he needs to perform tasks. But we want an agent able to interact with the world as it is now.
			<br>
			We don't model the world, we model the mind
			<br>
			---------notes
			<br>
			evolve with AI<br>
			a lot of people seem afraid of the development of AI (not for the reason), one of the reasons for this, is the potential threat for their job.
			AI will rip off job from people, there are no doubt about it. But it's not a reason to stop developing it, AI can and will be benefical for the world, it will help us progress, and if a lot of jobs will stop existing new one will be create, and more people will be involved in building a better world. If AI become to intelligent, we will need a way to keep up, and stay in charge (or maybe not), so we need to find ways to evolve and learn as fast as AI, maybe through neural lace...
			AI will help people innovate, and build stuff, imagine a world where we could ask a machine to build anything we ask. But maybe we will not need to do it, because AI would already had found the perfect solution ...

			General purpose intelligence,
			<br>
			---------notes-sad story bro
			<br>
			I applied to <a href="http://dac.lip6.fr/master/">this master</a> at the <a href="http://www.upmc.fr/en/">Pierre and Marie Curie</a> university in Paris, but they didn't even look at my application, they just forget about it, and when I asked what was up, they just said "wtf are you ? Oh you applied ?! well it's full, too late fucker". It was 6 weeks later, seriously they are just a bunch of shitassholeslickingassholesdickscuntscumbagholeshit.
