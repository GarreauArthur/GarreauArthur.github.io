title: "An exhaustive list of everything you need to know to become an AI expert"
layout: post
---

cqncpdp previously told that he wasn't going to make an exhaustive list of what
AI can do, so in extent, of what you need to know to build AI agents. So I
decided I was going to give it a try, and make a list of the required knowledge
to become an AI expert. This list will be continuously updated.

I don't consider myself an AI expert, I know most of the elements in the
list, but not everything (marked as unknown `[u]`). My goal is to minimize the
number of unknown subjects.
