Percetron was first referenced in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt. Rosenblatt focused
his attention on the feasibility of constructing a device possessing perception
and recognition abilities.

A perceptron is a system able to learn to recognize similarities or identities
between patterns of optical, electrical or tonal information, in a manner which
may be closely analogous to the perceptual processes of a biological brain. The
proposed system depends on probabilistic rather than deterministic principles
for its operation, and gains its reliability from the properties of statistical
measurements obtained from large populations of elements.

A system which operates according to these principles will be called a
perceptron.


In 1962

A perceptron is first and foremost a brain model, not an invention for pattern
recognition... its utility is in enabling us to determine the physical
conditions for the emergence of various psychological properties.
