# VERSION NUMBERS

I've recently start a new project, and I can't prevent myself from thinking too
much. And when I start thinking, things get messy and out of control. 

This time, I've been obsessed with version numbers.

## A more sophisticated workflow

As a french handsome man, I am very sophisticated

Work in master, everytime you have something to do, create branch

    git checkout -b "<branch-name>"

Every time you create a feature branch, you should:

* Write the documentation
* Write tests
* Implement the feature

TRACK EVERYTHING,
It's not a release version number
2 branches, master, develop,
create a branch:

* `f/<branch-name>` feature branch
* `m/<branch-name>` minor branch
* `p/<branch-name>` patch branch

## 4 numbers, bringing meaning to version numbers

Version numbers should reflect changes.

    Major.feature.minor.patch

* Major: major changes in the software
* feature: introduce a new feature
* minor: modify an existing feature of the software, but don't extend the
software
* patch: when we fixed something wrong


## about the name

I first thought about calling it sovenuc, but sovenut has nut in it, and the 12
yo me thinks that's funny
