# Fukken college

College is the place you need to go to get a degree, and have access to jobs
that interest you.

And that's pretty much it, you are not going to learn anything, you are going
to waste your time and money.

Because I am upset by college, I just want to keep a list of the reasons why :

* Professor see all the students struggling, shout at them for being stupid/lazy
* 5 exams, 2 lectures
