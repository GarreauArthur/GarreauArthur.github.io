I recently got interested by the flat earth society and its members.
I started looking at youtuber trying really hard to prove that the earth is
flat.

It is not just stupidity, it's deeper than that.
The problem is the belief system that these individuals have, and their
incapacity to accept that they are wrong.

Accepting to be wrong is extremely difficult, but it's the only way to become
better.

I am wrong, doing wrong, saying something wrong at least once a day. Maybe
not that often because I am really fucking smart, I am Rick and morty IQ level
genius.

# I hate being wrong

and everybody does hate it

I hate it so much that when I was 7, I asked my parents to stop helping me
doing my homework because I fucking hated when they said that I was wrong. 

And every time someone tells me that I am wrong, I disagree, I can't be wrong.
If they insist, I start thinking about it, and if I find that I am wrong, I try
to find case where I am not, I try to find a way not to be wrong.

Whenever I do that, I tell myself

## STOP, you are wrong, just STOP

You are wrong, you realized it, deal with it, learn and move on.
