title: Unconventional ways to use markdown to write better articles
date : 2018-01-01

Markdown is my favorite "tool" to write documents. Office ? LibreOffice ? No
thanks. LaTeX ? I am ok with it whenever I need to write mathematical formulae.
But everytime I have the choice I choose markdown. It's plain text, simple,
easy to write and to read even before any processing.

Markdown offers numerus notation to structure documents.
If you use these notations in an unconventional way, you can, I believe, write
better article.

The first trick is : I use the different sizes of headers to
highlight core ideas, sentences, or words, instead of using them for titles.

Instead of 

	# Main title
	
	intro

	## sub title

	### sub-sub title

	content

I do this :

	Everytime

	## Every single time

	# this is important

	the header is totally integrate into the content and is not considered
	as a title

## Did you get it ?

See ? it looks nice, doesn't it ?
