## Prerequisites

This articles is short explanation of what Dynamic Programming is, it supposes
that you already know about computational complexity and recursion.

## What's Dynamic Programming (DP) ?

There is a couple of ways to define DP. 
Dynamic programming is a general and powerful algorithmic design technique.

Dynamic programming refers to translating a problem to be solved into a
recurrence formula, and crunching this formula with the help of an array (or
any suitable collection) to save useful intermediates and avoid redundant work.
