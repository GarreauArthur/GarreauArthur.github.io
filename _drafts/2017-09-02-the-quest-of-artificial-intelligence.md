## discussing the meaning of AI

I like to define AI, as a set of tools and techniques to solve problems that
require intelligence. In other words, to solve problems for which we can't
describe a set of rules, a recipe to follow.

One could argue that such a problem which can be solved using an AI based
solution, doesn't require intelligence, because we are able to formulate a
solution. That's called the AI effect : every time somebody figured out how to
make a computer do something intelligent, critics argue that it is not real
intelligence. Sometimes AI is expressed as :

> AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.

This is similar to the "God of the Gaps" idea. Where God starts where our
understanding of the universe ends. So one could argue that intelligence does
not exist at all.

I think that leads us to make the difference between intelligence and
consciousness. Natural intelligence is instrinsically linked to some sort of
consciousness, feelings, understanding, instinct. We all are able to make
correct assumptions because "It makes sense".

I think this is what most people think about when referring to intelligence :
The ideas that we can solve problems without any models or algorithms, and that
we are conscious and can take initiative. 

The funny thing about that is that we can't really go far with this natural
intelligence ; we are not really good at thinking and solving problems so we
build and use models. We find representations that enable us to think and solve
problems. And computers help us solving these problems because we are not smart
enough.

This is an interesting subject and you can find a lot of books on the topic but
it is not the goal of this article.

## What is my purpose ? you pass butter

As mentioned previously, AI trys to solve problems that require intelligence.
However Artificial Intelligence is not just about solving problems for which we
can't explicitly write solutions.

Sometimes it's not that we are not able to find a solution to a problem, we
just can't calculate it.

A really common way to solve problem is to guess, what differs us from computer
is most of the time we only need a couple of guesses to get is right. Computer
can and need to try every guesses to find the right one. This is what we call
brute-force.
sometimes there are too many possibilities, for example chess :

* 10<sup>120</sup> possible games
* 10<sup>80</sup> atoms in the Universe
* $\pi.10^7$ seconds a year
* 10<sup>9</sup> nanoseconds in a second
* 10<sup>10</sup> year since the Big Bang
* 10<sup></sup>

We are not just succeeding building smart agents, they outperfom us.
