## swapmesh.com (2012-2018) [DEAD]

Swapmesh was a social network I made just after turning 17.
The original idea was to build a place where people could put small widgets of
things they enjoy, and have a kind of hub where they have everything they love.
It ended up being a social network where your personal page was called the
"interface", you were able to drag and drop content (status, link, post, images)
on your interface.

Features:

* personal interface to publish stuff (post, link, images, status, videos)
* research bar to find your friends
* friends list
* Feed to see what your friends have posted
* "interface comments" to post a comment on someone interface
* notification system
* personal notes, with the ability to drag and drop content to make a note from it
* "Public stream" to chat with other people on the website

I made it using HTML, CSS, javascript and PHP. Hosted it on a shared hosting plan,
pushing files using FTP.

It had about 100 users.
It was fun, I thought I was so cool. Spaghetti code, but it worked.

### Version 2 (2014) [UNFINISHED]

I worked on a second version, with a nicer UI. I built a WYSIWYG editor in js,
to let users write post with colors, bold, italic, code snippets, link and
images. It was a little bit buggy.

### jarvis console - chatbot before chatbots [DEAD]

To prevent having too many buttons, I decided to make a sort of console to let
people navigate on the website, ask to perform actions (post something, send a
message, find someone). Like a chatbot before chatbot. I was using RegEx, and
thought it was so cool that I decided to do the same but for computer. I wanted
to build an app to help automate 

## Japp (2015?) - Trying to solve unsolved CS problems [abandoned]

Too much thinking, not enough Object Oriented design experience and knowledge
Too big project.

## knowledge [FOREVER GOING]

Knowledge is not really a project, and is private. It is a collection of notes,
cheatsheet, articles on a lot of different things I've studied through the years.
As 2019, there is 43 directories and a total of 360 files. I didn't push it on
github to prevent copyright issues.

## Quantasks.com (2016-still up in 2019) - the perfectionnist idiot

Prototype
Beautiful code, properly designed, but some tricky unsolved problems

Quantasks was just a small part of a mastermind plan. Quantasks is a todo list
that let you split tasks into minimal actionable tasks: quantasks (because
quata are the smallest particles). The idea was to then learn how to split
tasks into actions that I could implement, so I could then build a virtual
assistant able to break down requests into actions it can take.

For some reason I kept it secret for 2 years, and showed it to a couple of people.
I wanted to make a subscription plan and market it as a new productivity method,
I started an instagram page where I posted motivational/productivity quotes.
But I never did it, because I felt like it wasn't good enough, it didn't provide
enough value to be able to ask for money.

Now, I realize that I should have known better. Keeping a project secret is dumb.
Trying to launch a perfect product is dumb. I am a dummy dum.

## What's next ?

Idk man, survive I guess

## Who am I ? just a bunch of facts about me

My name is Arthur Garreau (<small>it's written in giant up there</small>), I
study Computer Science, Electronics, Artificial Intelligence, Data... and I am
French. (idk if someone really cares)

I wrote my first line of code when I was 12yo, but got serious about it when I
was 15. I made a couple of interesting projects, but I shared a very few of
them, because I didn't want to share them, or I never finished them, or they
were not really interesting, u kno wat im sayin.

I have a licence (french equivalent of a bachelor, but not really) in
Electronics, Electrical Energy, and automatic.

I study computer science and electrical engineering at ESEO.
I studied at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, and the University
of Nantes.

I talk French, English, C, C++, PHP, Java, Javascript, SQL (MySQL, postgreSQl),
bash, python (numpy, matplotlib), HTML & CSS. I enjoy Mathematics and AI. I
know stuffs about Machine Learning and deep learning. 

I like to build stuffs, I love memes, I play the piano.
