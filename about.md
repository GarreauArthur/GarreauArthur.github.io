French. (idk if someone really cares)

I wrote my first line of code when I was 12yo, but got serious about it when I
was 15. I made a couple of interesting projects, but I shared a very few of
them, because I didn't want to share them, or I never finished them, or they
were not really interesting, u kno wat im sayin.
